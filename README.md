Welcome to my data analytics portfolio repository! Here you will find a collection of projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and manipulation.
Each project contains a detailed explanation of the problem statement, the data used, the approach taken, and the results obtained. The code and visualizations are provided for easy replication and understanding.
The projects cover a wide range of topics including but not limited to: marketing analytics, health analysis , customer segmentation, sales forecasting, sentiment analysis, and social media analytics. The data used is sourced from public datasets or from web scraping.
My aim is to demonstrate my ability to extract insights from data and present them in a clear and concise manner. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or collaborations.
Thank you for visiting and I hope you find the projects informative and useful.
